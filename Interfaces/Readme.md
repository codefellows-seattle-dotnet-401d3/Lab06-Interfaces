## Overview
So in my example I will be showing is about pokemon, each pokemon Character has is its own Class. Since interfaces allows for a method to be used across different classes, this is really important. Since the pokemon are need a parent class to gain methods from a hierarcy structure, Interfaces allow methods to be shared across different classes.
In my diagram, the Interface catchable is being implemnted by all pokemon except Picahcu. The Interface professor oak is only being implimented by 3 pokemon instead of all 7.
